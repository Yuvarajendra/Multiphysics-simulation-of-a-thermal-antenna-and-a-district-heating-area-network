# Multiphysics-simulation-of-a-thermal-antenna-and-a-district-heating-area-network

This project is aims to perform a study in order to investigate whether the current cooling system can keep the maximum operating temperature within 50 [degC] by considering the assumptions and geometrical simplifications of the model. Two simulations, steady state and transient state are performed here. The results from these simulations are presented so that the manufacturer of the antenna can have\ a better insight into the, temperature distribution, magnitudes of temperatures at important locations, time required to achieve thermal equilibrium and so on.
