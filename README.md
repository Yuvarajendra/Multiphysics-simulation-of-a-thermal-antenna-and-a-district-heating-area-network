# Multiphysics-simulation-of-a-thermal-antenna

This project is aims to perform a study in order to investigate whether the current cooling system can keep the maximum operating temperature within 50 [degC] by considering the assumptions and geometrical simplifications of the model. Two simulations, steady state and transient state are performed here. The results from these simulations are presented so that the manufacturer of the antenna can have\ a better insight into the, temperature distribution, magnitudes of temperatures at important locations, time required to achieve thermal equilibrium and so on.

# Multiphysics-simulation-of-a-district-heating-area-network

District heating (DH) by definition is referred to as a system that is being used for distributing heat for the commercial structures and the residential buildings or any other human made infrastructures that has the necessity for water heating or space heating through a system of insulated pipes in particular.

This project focuses on the case study of the influence of the piping layouts, particularly the pattern in which the pipes are laid out for the purpose of space heating of the football stadium. A simplified model of the DH network is considered here that consists of an industry, a football stadium and residential housings with a constant mass flow rate of water in the pipes. The football stadium is modeled in detail, whereas the industry and the residential housings are modeled as the heat sinks with a constant heat demand, though the demand varies every day or based on the certain period of the year. Three different patterns of the underground heating pipes are studied here. Stationary study is performed here over the transient study for the purpose of simplification.
